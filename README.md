# Dataset

Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) is a collection of public datasets for 3D medical image segmentation. This dataset is widely utilized to evaluate and validate the segmentation model performance of various organs. 
You can download MSD dataset from [this link](http://medicaldecathlon.com/).

## MSD2019 Task-04 Hippocampus

The Prostate dataset comprises 48 prostate multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) studies, incorporating two modalities: T2-weighted and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) sequences. Segmentation in this paper targeted two primary regions within the prostate: the Prostate Peripheral Zone (PZ) and the Transition Zone (TZ).


## MSD2019 Task-05 Prostate

The Hippocampus dataset consists of 394 3D MRI images, acquired using T1-weighted MPRAGE sequences. The main target regions in this dataset are the Anterior and Posterior parts of the Hippocampus, defined as segments of the hippocampus proper and the subiculum, respectively.

## Performance and Efficiency

We report both the segmentation performance and model complexity. Our proposed Lite Swin UNETR achieves favorable segmentation performance against existing methods, while being considerably reducing the model complexity. Best results are in bold.
