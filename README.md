# Dataset
## MSD2019 Task-04 Hippocampus

The Prostate dataset comprises 48 prostate multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) studies, incorporating two modalities: T2-weighted and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) sequences [22]. Segmentation in this paper targeted two primary regions within the prostate: the Prostate Peripheral Zone (PZ) and the Transition Zone (TZ).

## MSD2019 Task-05 Prostate

The Hippocampus dataset consists of 394 3D MRI images, acquired using T1-weighted MPRAGE sequences. The main target regions in this dataset are the Anterior and Posterior parts of the Hippocampus, defined as segments of the hippocampus proper and the subiculum, respectively.
